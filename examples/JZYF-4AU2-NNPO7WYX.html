On level one is reception and above the reception desk is a huge logo of a purple turkey vulture. Its haughty gaze is directed on the new receptionist's head. Holly Emmerson, who tries to love everything, shudders when she catches its beady eyes, but luckily she's not the type to make eye contact. Holly has only been working at Carrion for a week. She's excited to put calls through and welcome esteemed authors when they visit their editors or publicists. <br /><br />The reception job was hard to get. Apparently one needs references and experience to land a first job. Emails were sent to publishing companies and bookstores. Holly buttressed her emaciated CV since she's done no study apart from home-schooling and has never worked before. Somehow she landed one interview. She explained to the Facilities Manager that for all her reading life she's read books to her grandmother - who raised her and died three weeks ago - reading for four hours a day. "By the way, you have some powder on your nose," Holly had said, trying to be helpful. The manager laughed. "Powder? You're funny. You're hired."<br />The start of my life is now! Holly realized. The thought made her feel ashamed for wanting something more than she's had but also a dangerous undercurrent of hopeful excitement.<br /><br />A few days in, more danger of over-excitement soars. Holly stares in awe as Carrion's star author for young adults approaches. "Virginia Garg!" Holly says, jumping in glee then sitting with a sudden inferiority complex. Except... Virginia doesn't resemble her jacket photo. She has unbrushed hair, a mohair poncho, dirty (toothpaste?) trousered legs, and a fanged tooth framed by spinach. She's brought in her mangy dog that looks like her.<br />But wow! An ACTUAL connection with a phenomenal author! Holly is a fan of Virginia's "Galactic Rift" trilogy, especially for the heroine outcast - Ms. Nova Void: "a genetic experiment gone wrong."<br />The famous author stares at Holly's chest. "Red-head, huh? You're new, honey. Nice breasts. You single? Poly?"<br />A jealous bark...<br />"Kafka!" says Virginia adoringly to her dog, then turns to Holly. "Today I am lunching with the biggest bitch at Carrion..." She looks at Holly, expecting her to call the bitch to reception.<br />"Um... who...?" says Holly. "Sorry."<br />"I told you!" Virginia says. "The biggest bitch here! Audrey. My publicist."<br />Holly calls, and soon Head Publicist, Audrey Ford, sashays towards them in perilously high stilettos. "Virginia, daarling!" she says. Whereas Virginia's voice is like a smoker's cough, Audrey's is like a French dove with a near-laughing coo. The women air-kiss. Kafka's teeth make ribbons of Audrey's tights then he howls. Virginia starts howling with him. Between sobs and hiccups, the brilliant author wails, "Help me, Audrey! I can't write it! You can't make me! I've never written a memoir. I can only write novels for young adults because I have arrested development!" She looks defiant like a child refusing bath-time, then lies on the beige couch with Kafka whimpering on her belly and Audrey stroking her forehead.<br />"You're amaaazing," says Audrey earnestly. A stream of soothing prattle follows: "You're so talented. You're our favorite author. You're my favorite novelist. You can do it! We have faith in you. You're the BEST writer. You're Carrion's FINEST!"<br />On it goes... Holly watches, mesmerized, aghast.<br />It works!<br />With every honeyed word, Virginia looks less insane. Carrion's treasured author sits up from the couch of beige mediocrity and failure. Smiles at Audrey Ford. Smiles at Holly Emmerson: lowly receptionist. The power-women leave. They don't say goodbye to Holly but Kafka does, raising his leg in au revoir and yellow trickle puddles on the reception floor.<br />Holly collects the cleaning equipment with a myriad of feelings, mostly gratitude. What a dream to be in Virginia Garg's orbit, she thinks. Although, would she like to BE Virginia? she wonders. Aah. Perhaps, if it was Virginia MINUS: her fame, her pup, her personality, her clothes sense, her looks, her voice, and her smell of citrus covering wet dog. I am so happy being me, Holly thinks, now I've hit the jackpot here! I want to stay at Carrion Books forever!<br /><br />Later that week, Holly receives a call from the familiar voice. <br />"Audrey?!"<br />"Oh, Virginia! This is Holly, on reception. I will transfer you now to Audrey."<br />"Gah, I forgot. There's always a receptionist in the way when I call this number. Whatever, I have news!" says Virginia excitedly. "And, honey, I just had an idea! How 'bout you come to my place after work and I'll tell you my news in the flesh?"<br />"Your place... to come over?" squeaks Holly. "Me?!"  <br />"You."<br />"Oh! Yes! Thank you SO much! Oh! Could we please talk about Nova Void? I feel SUCH a kinship with that character!"<br />Virginia provides Holly with her number and address, then Holly transfers the call. Soon, the news spreads through Carrion. Virginia has won the Charlotte's Web Award: the biggest prize in children's and YA publishing! An annual award presented with big money, much international fuss, and kudos for Carrion. Phillip Pullman and JK Rowling are in Manhattan for the award ceremony! Holly hears snippets as Carrion's horde exit past reception to go out for lunch. She overhears Audrey: "I'm scared the woman won't brush her hair. I've told her no socks with crocs or Uggs, that ponchos are banned. But I can't guarantee her speech won't get her canceled."<br /><br />At 5:30pm Holly rushes from Carrion to the apartment. Before knocking on Virginia's door, she hears conversation inside. Virginia's voice. "I have won the Charlotte's Web! YOU believe it, don't you? I am a champion." A pause. "I am THE champion." Another pause.<br />Holly hears the horrible dog bark, but who is Virginia talking to? <br />"Kafka, my heart, I would die of loneliness without you. You're the only boy I can stand. But I need a girlfriend," Virginia says. "Coming home from the ceremony would be like a popstar all alone in their hotel after their epic concert." Holly hears Kafka woof again and Virginia replying, "You're right, Kafka, you're clearly a critic of melodrama, and what I'm saying is not true: YOU'LL be here, and I'll host an after-party. When I've finished having sex with this girlie I'll start inviting everyone. Meanwhile, sex with this woman could be the answer to it all: loneliness, touch starvation, boredom, ennui, indecision, power loss, writer's block, lack of fun, fears, and any other emotion." Virginia laughs. "And then... How big should I make my celebration party?! I will invite some press acquaintances too. And that literati-"It"-girl, Samira Sato?! Maybe I could only invite women and actually ENJOY myself! Or would that be career suicide? Ha! Could ANYTHING be career suicide after such a win as the Charlotte?!"<br /><br />A frightened Holly knocks. Virginia opens the door, this time wearing a muumuu, grubby track-pants, and Ugg boots. <br />"Heeyy, Red-Head," Virginia drawls, her hand on her hip. "Come in, honey."<br />Virginia's laugh, like her voice, is a croak: hoarse in a way that reminds Holly to get the latest flu shot. Virginia steps closer and all Holly sees are her eyes protruding. Holly feels both faintness and the sensation that someone is squeezing her wrist like an ever-tightening bangle and in these strange seconds confusion reigns: Is it her imagination or is there really a vice grip on her right wrist? <br />What would Grandma have advised, she thinks wildly. Holly's grandmother had told Holly she was born to be a 'helper.' A prophecy Holly has never warmed to; she surmises that after thirty-five years of trying to live up to the decree, that it's very hard to be what one was born to be.<br />"I think I know your news," says Holly hesitantly. "Congratulations, Virginia!" <br />Virginia lets her grip go and nervously Holly scuffs her flats into Virginia's hallway rug littered in dog toys.<br />"It's incredible!" says Virginia. "I just wish I could accept the award with Kafka. I'd tell 'em, I can't write without him. Together we lounge on the bed with the laptop, Kafka barking when I stop typing."<br />They both look at Kafka. <br />Outside the dirty window it's raining now. Holly loathes the dog that's now barking at her and wishes she were in the rain. She looks at Virginia's books, all in a row, plus their translations in thirty-seven languages. She skitters from one end of the bookcase to the other.<br />The rain seems to make Virginia horny. She walks over and touches Holly's hip.<br />Holly feels the opposite of helpful. And she feels hypervigilant. Virginia closes her bulging eyeballs, so Holly shuts down her eyes too. It intensities the repulsion and strain. Eyes springing open, Holly sees the fang coming towards her. Dumbly frozen, she feels it press then splice her lip. When the shock wears off it's replaced with a spasm of disgust. Then a fluttering panic. Holly tells herself it's good to get her first kiss, even though her grandmother had said she was better off without such things. But her heart thumps more and more violently and the kiss does not seem to be ending so Holly pushes Virginia but her hands accidentally use Virginia's breasts to push, which only excites Virginia more. Holly, the definition of decorum, instead decides to cough and splutters a polite "ahem" into Virginia's open mouth on hers, and when Virginia moves her head back and swears, Holly twists her head so fast it's nearly whiplash, and says in the flash of the inspired, "Sorry! I just remembered my dog allergy."<br />"What happens to you?" Virginia's tone is not pleased. <br />"Hives!" Holly steps further back. "Coughing, as you see! And the usual..."<br />"Hives, hey? You'll have to show me them," Virginia says playfully, recovering, then Holly feels Virginia's arm around her waist, pulling her, and it occurs to the receptionist that all of this could be seen as an honor. It is VIRGINIA GARG, and she is lucky that this author could want something from her, that she should always remember her grandmother's words that she is a HELPER, and that that is her calling and that she must always practice gratitude. <br />"Thank you," Holly whispers, depressed.<br />Virginia grabs Holly's wrist again, the one which isn't purpling, to usher her into the living room. Holly touches the lip that feels like it's been sliced by a blade. Blood is on her finger. Don't freak out, Holly thinks.<br />"Thanks for coming over, honey. You're a good kisser."<br />"Oh. I AM?" Holly is simultaneously flattered and revolted.<br />"You know you are, you minx." <br />Virginia pours them champagne in crystal flutes.<br />Holly has never tried alcohol before. Her grandmother forbade it. Taking a sip, she winces. One sip will be enough. If she can get away with it. When Virginia raises an eyebrow, Holly's trembling hands spill the fancy drink on her dress. Virginia is too quick with the napkins.<br />"Oh!" Holly says in protest. A short circuit is in her brain. No coherence. No thoughts.<br />"What do you want as your safe word?"<br />"Oh. What?"<br />Holly wonders if Virginia might sense her frozen state: that although thoughts are whirring she can't talk and is maybe useless.<br />Virginia leans forward. "It's okay, honey, we don't need words."<br />Then Virginia kisses Holly again. It's worse this time. Holly is stricken by the red tongue of the author, that thick, insistent slab, in the black hole of her mouth, with that sword-tooth, invading, making little blood-slices of her own mouth, and then- like a battering ram - opening, prizing wide, to enter, probe, touch the roof, poke her gums, clean her teeth, touch her tonsils.<br />Holly, panicking, pulls Virginia's hair - jolts it up in a frantic yank. Then she sprints down the hall to the door, grabbing her bag at the entrance, as she hears Virginia swear in surprise and Kafka bellow.<br /><br />When Holly returns to her studio in Hell's Kitchen, a sub-lease with no radiator or air-conditioning, she lies in bed. Closes her eyes - numb. One thought arises; it sticks around invasively: it's the epiphany that Holly had felt when her grandmother had died - the realization that Holly was a tectonic plate breaking away from its body of land to become an island. The guilt from this had made her throw herself on the dead-cold chest of her grandmother and cry in obedience, trying to attach herself to landmass once more.<br />The thought, the feeling, is so intense that Holly considers going back and apologizing to Virginia Garg. Virginia Garg LIKED her. And she'd ran out rudely, not using her words, completely inept, an unfit member of the human race for leaving like that. Holly stares at the ceiling cracks. I wish I were a clear communicator like an author, she thinks. It's no wonder Virginia misread my feelings! Holly stares at one crack which looks like the vulture logo that's the bane of her existence at work. She wishes she had a friend so she could get a hug, so she could survive all this. But she wouldn't know how to go about making a friend. Her grandmother had told her friends were unnecessary because Holly had her. "I hate you, Grandma," Holly says aloud, surprising herself because she didn't know she did. She wonders, Is it possible to get another job? <br />No.<br />It is not!<br />It is not possible!<br />Holly believes she's not one of these people who can just get a job. This position is the one and only golden egg. But meeting the authors that come in... She doesn't want to do that anymore. <br />Holly never wanted for money when she was looking after her grandmother but after the will was read out Holly realized money would be a factor now that her grandmother had given every cent and the brownstone to a psychic on television that her grandmother had found "inspiring." The miracle of the job at Carrion has given Holly her first bank account. Stricken, Holly listens to noises in the room: cars whizzing by, horns and alarms, sirens wailing, the clanging pipe, a neighbor playing show-tunes, a violin 'practicing,' and a neighbor playing a meditation of whale acoustics. Hell. In the night Holly worries her wound has become septic; it looks like a lobster has taken residence on her lip.<br /><br />It's raining the next day too. At lunch break Holly accepts the rain like she accepted her lot with her grandmother, and without an umbrella finds a semi-waterproof bus shelter. She turns her cell on. Oh God, she had pulled the author's hair. She needs to call and beg Virginia - to make everything alright - but she's too petrified of her to call.<br /><br />Back at her desk, Holly receives an email from her manager. He has set up a meeting with himself, Holly, and HR, tomorrow. Holly doesn't think it's a promotion. Now she really needs to call Virginia. She feels faint and can't do her job properly.<br /><br />When Holly arrives home she calls. The phone is answered and Holly is surprised to hear background party noises. Virginia's first words are a teasing "We're waiting for you, Belle!"<br />"Yeah! Hurry up! The alcohol's running out!" Holly hears another woman holler. There's some whoops.<br />"I'm not Belle. Sorry! This is Holly Emmerson speaking. Um. Receptionist? You are having a party? Sorry. I was hoping I could um talk to you-"<br />"Not interested."<br />"Sorry! I didn't know if I should be calling you - I'll be very quick - I just want to say-"<br />"I. Am. Not. Interested. Goodbye." <br />Holly hears a man say, "Must be a damned telemarketer."<br />"Just one second more. Please!" begs Holly. "I'm so sorry to call when you're celebrating... And-" Her tone is tremulous, questioning. "I don't want... hurt, I guess. That's all. And-"<br />"Seriously," seethes Virginia. "I'm hanging up now. I'm not interested in your telemarketing."<br />"Wait! Oh! One more second! PLEASE help me, Virginia! I think they're going to fire me tomorrow because you must have told them I left your place so rudely. If you could help? I know we were going to be, um, friends before... that... I mean, er, what happened... and- Oh! I'm sorry that I don't, um, want to be more than friends - I know you do, and I was upset about... and I know you're busy now... but... Oh! To lose my job is the end of the-"<br />Virginia hangs up.<br /><br />Holly gets no sleep and is shaky and tearful. The HR meeting at 9am is brutal. Holly's fired for being an "erotomaniac-stalker." Virginia has stated that the receptionist had the audacity to VISIT her premises! A restraining order will take effect, as well as the dismissal. When asked to speak, Holly cannot. She leaves Carrion Books for the last time in tears. <br /><br />The fracas receives a minute's air-time on Twitter. Audrey Ford tweets "No-one's famous til they get a stalker." But Samira Sato rocks the thread; the twenty-nine-year-old Japanese-American genius memoirist/journalist, tweets how "funny" it is that Virginia seems to "collect" stalkers. "Doesn't everyone remember Garg's stalker from last year?! The girl who worked at the Strand?" This tweet of Samira's receives retweets, enough for word to get back to Virginia and cause her and Kafka sleepless nights.<br /><br />Soon, Holly is evicted because she can't find a job and can't pay rent. But she finds love! A relationship with Samira Sato, in fact. They meet when Samira wants to interview Holly about the stalking allegations for a journalistic piece and they bond over their antagonism with Virginia. It's not long before Holly U-hauls with Samira and Samira helps her land a job at Greenlight bookstore. Holly has never experienced such joy. Her heart finally feels at peace.<p hidden id="story-draft-plain" class="story-draft-plain">Carrion Books, one of the 'Big Five' publishers, is located on the south-east of Central Park.

Her grandmother forbade it. Taking a sip, she winces. One sip will be enough. If she can get away with it. When Virginia raises an eyebrow, Holly's trembling hands spill the fancy drink on her dress. Virginia is too quick with the napkins.<br />"Oh!" Holly says in protest. A short circuit is in her brain. No coherence. No thoughts.<br />"What do you want as your safe word?"<br />"Oh. What?"<br />Holly wonders if Virginia might sense her frozen state: that although thoughts are whirring she can't talk and is maybe useless.<br />Virginia leans forward. "It's okay, honey, we don't need words."<br />Then Virginia kisses Holly again. It's worse this time. Holly is stricken by the red tongue of the author, that thick, insistent slab, in the black hole of her mouth, with that sword-tooth, invading, making little blood-slices of her own mouth, and then- like a battering ram - opening, prizing wide, to enter, probe, touch the roof, poke her gums, clean her teeth, touch her tonsils.<br />Holly, panicking, pulls Virginia's hair - jolts it up in a frantic yank. Then she sprints down the hall to the door, grabbing her bag at the entrance, as she hears Virginia swear in surprise and Kafka bellow.<br /><br />When Holly returns to her studio in Hell's Kitchen, a sub-lease with no radiator or air-conditioning, she lies in bed. Closes her eyes - numb. One thought arises; it sticks around invasively: it's the epiphany that Holly had felt when her grandmother had died - the realization that Holly was a tectonic plate breaking away from its body of land to become an island. The guilt from this had made her throw herself on the dead-cold chest of her grandmother and cry in obedience, trying to attach herself to landmass once more.<br />The thought, the feeling, is so intense that Holly considers going back and apologizing to Virginia Garg. Virginia Garg LIKED her. And she'd ran out rudely, not using her words, completely inept, an unfit member of the human race for leaving like that. Holly stares at the ceiling cracks. I wish I were a clear communicator like an author, she thinks. It's no wonder Virginia misread my feelings! Holly stares at one crack which looks like the vulture logo that's the bane of her existence at work. She wishes she had a friend so she could get a hug, so she could survive all this. But she wouldn't know how to go about making a friend. Her grandmother had told her friends were unnecessary because Holly had her. "I hate you, Grandma," Holly says aloud, surprising herself because she didn't know she did. She wonders, Is it possible to get another job? <br />No.<br />It is not!<br />It is not possible!<br />Holly believes she's not one of these people who can just get a job. This position is the one and only golden egg. But meeting the authors that come in... She doesn't want to do that anymore. <br />Holly never wanted for money when she was looking after her grandmother but after the will was read out Holly realized money would be a factor now that her grandmother had given every cent and the brownstone to a psychic on television that her grandmother had found "inspiring." The miracle of the job at Carrion has given Holly her first bank account. Stricken, Holly listens to noises in the room: cars whizzing by, horns and alarms, sirens wailing, the clanging pipe, a neighbor playing show-tunes, a violin 'practicing,' and a neighbor playing a meditation of whale acoustics. Hell. In the night Holly worries her wound has become septic; it looks like a lobster has taken residence on her lip.<br /><br />It's raining the next day too. At lunch break Holly accepts the rain like she accepted her lot with her grandmother, and without an umbrella finds a semi-waterproof bus shelter. She turns her cell on. Oh God, she had pulled the author's hair. She needs to call and beg Virginia - to make everything alright - but she's too petrified of her to call.<br /><br />Back at her desk, Holly receives an email from her manager. He has set up a meeting with himself, Holly, and HR, tomorrow. Holly doesn't think it's a promotion. Now she really needs to call Virginia. She feels faint and can't do her job properly.<br /><br />When Holly arrives home she calls. The phone is answered and Holly is surprised to hear background party noises. Virginia's first words are a teasing "We're waiting for you, Belle!"<br />"Yeah! Hurry up! The alcohol's running out!" Holly hears another woman holler. There's some whoops.<br />"I'm not Belle. Sorry! This is Holly Emmerson speaking. Um. Receptionist? You are having a party? Sorry. I was hoping I could um talk to you-"<br />"Not interested."<br />"Sorry! I didn't know if I should be calling you - I'll be very quick - I just want to say-"<br />"I. Am. Not. Interested. Goodbye." <br />Holly hears a man say, "Must be a damned telemarketer."<br />"Just one second more. Please!" begs Holly. "I'm so sorry to call when you're celebrating... And-" Her tone is tremulous, questioning. "I don't want... hurt, I guess. That's all. And-"<br />"Seriously," seethes Virginia. "I'm hanging up now. I'm not interested in your telemarketing."<br />"Wait! Oh! One more second! PLEASE help me, Virginia! I think they're going to fire me tomorrow because you must have told them I left your place so rudely. If you could help? I know we were going to be, um, friends before... that... I mean, er, what happened... and- Oh! I'm sorry that I don't, um, want to be more than friends - I know you do, and I was upset about... and I know you're busy now... but... Oh! To lose my job is the end of the-"<br />Virginia hangs up.<br /><br />Holly gets no sleep and is shaky and tearful. The HR meeting at 9am is brutal. Holly's fired for being an "erotomaniac-stalker." Virginia has stated that the receptionist had the audacity to VISIT her premises! A restraining order will take effect, as well as the dismissal. When asked to speak, Holly cannot. She leaves Carrion Books for the last time in tears. <br /><br />The fracas receives a minute's air-time on Twitter. Audrey Ford tweets "No-one's famous til they get a stalker." But Samira Sato rocks the thread; the twenty-nine-year-old Japanese-American genius memoirist/journalist, tweets how "funny" it is that Virginia seems to "collect" stalkers. "Doesn't everyone remember Garg's stalker from last year?! The girl who worked at the Strand?" This tweet of Samira's receives retweets, enough for word to get back to Virginia and cause her and Kafka sleepless nights.<br /><br />Soon, Holly is evicted because she can't find a job and can't pay rent. But she finds love! A relationship with Samira Sato, in fact. They meet when Samira wants to interview Holly about the stalking allegations for a journalistic piece and they bond over their antagonism with Virginia. It's not long before Holly U-hauls with Samira and Samira helps her land a job at Greenlight bookstore. Holly has never experienced such joy. Her heart finally feels at peace.<p hidden id="story-draft-highlighted" class="story-draft-highlighted">Carrion Books, one of the 'Big Five' publishers, is located on the south-east of Central Park. On level one is reception and above the reception desk is a huge logo of a purple turkey vulture. Its haughty gaze is directed on the new receptionist's head. Holly Emmerson, who tries to love everything, shudders when she catches its beady eyes, but luckily she's not the type to make eye contact. Holly has only been working at Carrion for a week. She's excited to put calls through and welcome esteemed authors when they visit their editors or publicists. <br /><br />The reception job was hard to get. Apparently one needs references and experience to land a first job. Emails were sent to publishing companies and bookstores. Holly buttressed her emaciated CV since she's done no study apart from home-schooling and has never worked before. Somehow she landed one interview. She explained to the Facilities Manager that for all her reading life she's read books to her grandmother - who raised her and died three weeks ago - reading for four hours a day. "By the way, you have some powder on your nose," Holly had said, trying to be helpful. The manager laughed. "Powder? You're funny. You're hired."<br />The start of my life is now! Holly realized. The thought made her feel ashamed for wanting something more than she's had but also a dangerous undercurrent of hopeful excitement.<br /><br />A few days in, more danger of over-excitement soars. Holly stares in awe as Carrion's star author for young adults approaches. "Virginia Garg!" Holly says, jumping in glee then sitting with a sudden inferiority complex. Except... Virginia doesn't resemble her jacket photo. She has unbrushed hair, a mohair poncho, dirty (toothpaste?) trousered legs, and a fanged tooth framed by spinach. She's brought in her mangy dog that looks like her.<br />But wow! An ACTUAL connection with a phenomenal author! Holly is a fan of Virginia's "Galactic Rift" trilogy, especially for the heroine outcast - Ms. Nova Void: "a genetic experiment gone wrong."<br />The famous author stares at Holly's chest. "Red-head, huh? You're new, honey. Nice breasts. You single? Poly?"<br />A jealous bark...<br />"Kafka!" says Virginia adoringly to her dog, then turns to Holly. "Today I am lunching with the biggest bitch at Carrion..." She looks at Holly, expecting her to call the bitch to reception.<br />"Um... who...?" says Holly. "Sorry."<br />"I told you!" Virginia says. "The biggest bitch here! Audrey. My publicist."<br />Holly calls, and soon Head Publicist, Audrey Ford, sashays towards them in perilously high stilettos. "Virginia, daarling!" she says. Whereas Virginia's voice is like a smoker's cough, Audrey's is like a French dove with a near-laughing coo. The women air-kiss. Kafka's teeth make ribbons of Audrey's tights then he howls. Virginia starts howling with him. Between sobs and hiccups, the brilliant author wails, "Help me, Audrey! I can't write it! You can't make me! I've never written a memoir. I can only write novels for young adults because I have arrested development!" She looks defiant like a child refusing bath-time, then lies on the beige couch with Kafka whimpering on her belly and Audrey stroking her forehead.<br />"You're amaaazing," says Audrey earnestly. A stream of soothing prattle follows: "You're so talented. You're our favorite author. You're my favorite novelist. You can do it! We have faith in you. You're the BEST writer. You're Carrion's FINEST!"<br />On it goes... Holly watches, mesmerized, aghast.<br />It works!<br />With every honeyed word, Virginia looks less insane. Carrion's treasured author sits up from the couch of beige mediocrity and failure. Smiles at Audrey Ford. Smiles at Holly Emmerson: lowly receptionist. The power-women leave. They don't say goodbye to Holly but Kafka does, raising his leg in au revoir and yellow trickle puddles on the reception floor.<br />Holly collects the cleaning equipment with a myriad of feelings, mostly gratitude. What a dream to be in Virginia Garg's orbit, she thinks. Although, would she like to BE Virginia? she wonders. Aah. Perhaps, if it was Virginia MINUS: her fame, her pup, her personality, her clothes sense, her looks, her voice, and her smell of citrus covering wet dog. I am so happy being me, Holly thinks, now I've hit the jackpot here! I want to stay at Carrion Books forever!<br /><br />Later that week, Holly receives a call from the familiar voice. <br />"Audrey?!"<br />"Oh, Virginia! This is Holly, on reception. I will transfer you now to Audrey."<br />"Gah, I forgot. There's always a receptionist in the way when I call this number. Whatever, I have news!" says Virginia excitedly. "And, honey, I just had an idea! How 'bout you come to my place after work and I'll tell you my news in the flesh?"<br />"Your place... to come over?" squeaks Holly. "Me?!"  <br />"You."<br />"Oh! Yes! Thank you SO much! Oh! Could we please talk about Nova Void? I feel SUCH a kinship with that character!"<br />Virginia provides Holly with her number and address, then Holly transfers the call. Soon, the news spreads through Carrion. Virginia has won the Charlotte's Web Award: the biggest prize in children's and YA publishing! An annual award presented with big money, much international fuss, and kudos for Carrion. Phillip Pullman and JK Rowling are in Manhattan for the award ceremony! Holly hears snippets as Carrion's horde exit past reception to go out for lunch. She overhears Audrey: "I'm scared the woman won't brush her hair. I've told her no socks with crocs or Uggs, that ponchos are banned. But I can't guarantee her speech won't get her canceled."<br /><br />At 5:30pm Holly rushes from Carrion to the apartment. Before knocking on Virginia's door, she hears conversation inside. Virginia's voice. "I have won the Charlotte's Web! YOU believe it, don't you? I am a champion." A pause. "I am THE champion." Another pause.<br />Holly hears the horrible dog bark, but who is Virginia talking to? <br />"Kafka, my heart, I would die of loneliness without you. You're the only boy I can stand. But I need a girlfriend," Virginia says. "Coming home from the ceremony would be like a popstar all alone in their hotel after their epic concert." Holly hears Kafka woof again and Virginia replying, "You're right, Kafka, you're clearly a critic of melodrama, and what I'm saying is not true: YOU'LL be here, and I'll host an after-party. When I've finished having sex with this girlie I'll start inviting everyone. Meanwhile, sex with this woman could be the answer to it all: loneliness, touch starvation, boredom, ennui, indecision, power loss, writer's block, lack of fun, fears, and any other emotion." Virginia laughs. "And then... How big should I make my celebration party?! I will invite some press acquaintances too. And that literati-"It"-girl, Samira Sato?! Maybe I could only invite women and actually ENJOY myself! Or would that be career suicide? Ha! Could ANYTHING be career suicide after such a win as the Charlotte?!"<br /><br />A frightened Holly knocks. Virginia opens the door, this time wearing a muumuu, grubby track-pants, and Ugg boots. <br />"Heeyy, Red-Head," Virginia drawls, her hand on her hip. "Come in, honey."<br />Virginia's laugh, like her voice, is a croak: hoarse in a way that reminds Holly to get the latest flu shot. Virginia steps closer and all Holly sees are her eyes protruding. Holly feels both faintness and the sensation that someone is squeezing her wrist like an ever-tightening bangle and in these strange seconds confusion reigns: Is it her imagination or is there really a vice grip on her right wrist? <br />What would Grandma have advised, she thinks wildly. Holly's grandmother had told Holly she was born to be a 'helper.' A prophecy Holly has never warmed to; she surmises that after thirty-five years of trying to live up to the decree, that it's very hard to be what one was born to be.<br />"I think I know your news," says Holly hesitantly. "Congratulations, Virginia!" <br />Virginia lets her grip go and nervously Holly scuffs her flats into Virginia's hallway rug littered in dog toys.<br />"It's incredible!" says Virginia. "I just wish I could accept the award with Kafka. I'd tell 'em, I can't write without him. Together we lounge on the bed with the laptop, Kafka barking when I stop typing."<br />They both look at Kafka. <br />Outside the dirty window it's raining now. Holly loathes the dog that's now barking at her and wishes she were in the rain. She looks at Virginia's books, all in a row, plus their translations in thirty-seven languages. She skitters from one end of the bookcase to the other.<br />The rain seems to make Virginia horny. She walks over and touches Holly's hip.<br />Holly feels the opposite of helpful. And she feels hypervigilant. Virginia closes her bulging eyeballs, so Holly shuts down her eyes too. It intensities the repulsion and strain. Eyes springing open, Holly sees the fang coming towards her. Dumbly frozen, she feels it press then splice her lip. When the shock wears off it's replaced with a spasm of disgust. Then a fluttering panic. Holly tells herself it's good to get her first kiss, even though her grandmother had said she was better off without such things. But her heart thumps more and more violently and the kiss does not seem to be ending so Holly pushes Virginia but her hands accidentally use Virginia's breasts to push, which only excites Virginia more. Holly, the definition of decorum, instead decides to cough and splutters a polite "ahem" into Virginia's open mouth on hers, and when Virginia moves her head back and swears, Holly twists her head so fast it's nearly whiplash, and says in the flash of the inspired, "Sorry! I just remembered my dog allergy."<br />"What happens to you?" Virginia's tone is not pleased. <br />"Hives!" Holly steps further back. "Coughing, as you see! And the usual..."<br />"Hives, hey? You'll have to show me them," Virginia says playfully, recovering, then Holly feels Virginia's arm around her waist, pulling her, and it occurs to the receptionist that all of this could be seen as an honor. It is VIRGINIA GARG, and she is lucky that this author could want something from her, that she should always remember her grandmother's words that she is a HELPER, and that that is her calling and that she must always practice gratitude. <br />"Thank you," Holly whispers, depressed.<br />Virginia grabs Holly's wrist again, the one which isn't purpling, to usher her into the living room. Holly touches the lip that feels like it's been sliced by a blade. Blood is on her finger. Don't freak out, Holly thinks.<br />"Thanks for coming over, honey. You're a good kisser."<br />"Oh. I AM?" Holly is simultaneously flattered and revolted.<br />"You know you are, you minx." <br />Virginia pours them champagne in crystal flutes.<br />Holly has never tried alcohol before. Her grandmother forbade it. Taking a sip, she winces. One sip will be enough. If she can get away with it. When Virginia raises an eyebrow, Holly's trembling hands spill the fancy drink on her dress. Virginia is too quick with the napkins.<br />"Oh!" Holly says in protest. A short circuit is in her brain. No coherence. No thoughts.<br />"What do you want as your safe word?"<br />"Oh. What?"<br />Holly wonders if Virginia might sense her frozen state: that although thoughts are whirring she can't talk and is maybe useless.<br />Virginia leans forward. "It's okay, honey, we don't need words."<br />Then Virginia kisses Holly again. It's worse this time. Holly is stricken by the red tongue of the author, that thick, insistent slab, in the black hole of her mouth, with that sword-tooth, invading, making little blood-slices of her own mouth, and then- like a battering ram - opening, prizing wide, to enter, probe, touch the roof, poke her gums, clean her teeth, touch her tonsils.<br />Holly, panicking, pulls Virginia's hair - jolts it up in a frantic yank. Then she sprints down the hall to the door, grabbing her bag at the entrance, as she hears Virginia swear in surprise and Kafka bellow.<br /><br />When Holly returns to her studio in Hell's Kitchen, a sub-lease with no radiator or air-conditioning, she lies in bed. Closes her eyes - numb. One thought arises; it sticks around invasively: it's the epiphany that Holly had felt when her grandmother had died - the realization that Holly was a tectonic plate breaking away from its body of land to become an island. The guilt from this had made her throw herself on the dead-cold chest of her grandmother and cry in obedience, trying to attach herself to landmass once more.<br />The thought, the feeling, is so intense that Holly considers going back and apologizing to Virginia Garg.

Stricken, Holly listens to noises in the room: cars whizzing by, horns and alarms, sirens wailing, the clanging pipe, a neighbor playing show-tunes, a violin 'practicing,' and a neighbor playing a meditation of whale acoustics.

On level one is reception, a clinically white waiting area with a bookshelf boasting new releases. Above the reception desk is a huge logo of a purple turkey vulture. Its haughty gaze seems to rest on the top of the receptionist's head. Ginger Emmerson who tries to love everything shudders when she accidentally looks at its black beady eyes but luckily she is not the type to often make eye contact or raise her eyes from the ground. <br /><br /><br />Ginger had never been one for dating or flirting. She was content being alone, taking care of her ailing grandmother until she passed away three months ago. With no relatives left, Ginger found herself without a purpose or a job. It was then that she decided to take a chance and apply for a receptionist position at a publishing house in Manhattan.<br /><br />Ginger was eager to learn and prove herself. Her first few weeks on the job were hectic and overwhelming, but she quickly adapted to the fast-paced environment. She felt proud of herself knowing that she was contributing to a Big 5 publishing house.<br /><br />One afternoon, Ginger was manning the front desk when she noticed a commotion in the lobby. There was a group of people huddled around a woman who was signing books and posing for pictures. Ginger recognized her instantly as Virginia, the highly acclaimed author who had won numerous awards for her literary works.<br /><br />Ginger was a fan of Virginia's writing and couldn't believe that she was standing right in front of her. As Virginia made her way towards the elevator, Ginger timidly approached her and introduced herself. Virginia smiled warmly and thanked Ginger for her help in directing fans to her book signing. Ginger couldn't believe that she was actually having a conversation with Virginia.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, Virginia continued to come into the publishing house. Ginger would greet her with a smile and they started to chat more often. Ginger couldn't believe that she had made a connection with someone so talented and successful.<br /><br />One day, Virginia lingered at the front desk longer than usual. She leaned in towards Ginger and said that she found her intriguing. Ginger wasn't sure what Virginia meant, but she felt her heart start to race. Virginia then suggested they go for a drink after work, to which Ginger nervously agreed.<br /><br />As they sat in a trendy bar sipping wine, Virginia started to flirt with Ginger. Ginger had never experienced anything like it before and didn't know how to react. She admired Virginia but was not interested in anything more than a friendship.<br /><br />Virginia seemed to pick up on Ginger's discomfort and backed off, but Ginger couldn't shake the feeling that things had changed between them. She still wanted to be friends with Virginia but wondered if their relationship would be awkward now.<br /><br />A few weeks later, Virginia won a prestigious publishing prize. Everyone at the office was ecstatic for her, and Ginger was thrilled that Virginia had achieved such an incredible feat. However, Ginger noticed that something had changed in Virginia. She seemed more distant and preoccupied with her newfound fame.<br /><br />One day, Ginger overheard Virginia talking to one of her colleagues about a "crazy stalker" who had been bothering her. Ginger couldn't believe her ears. She knew that Virginia was referring to her when she said that the stalker had been coming to her apartment and sending her threatening messages.<br /><br />Ginger was mortified. She had never stalked anyone, and the accusation was unfounded. She tried to confront Virginia about it, but Virginia shut her down completely. Ginger soon realized that Virginia cared more about her reputation than their friendship.<br /><br />Ginger was let go from the publishing house due to Virginia's claims. She was devastated and embarrassed, not knowing how she would be able to find another job. Her confidence had been shattered, and she felt isolated.<br /><br />Months went by, and Ginger tried to move on from the experience. She started to focus on her own writing and was surprised at how much she enjoyed it. One day, she received a letter in the mail. It was from Virginia.<br /><br />In the letter, Virginia admitted that she had made a mistake and had lied about the stalking accusations to protect her image. She went on to say that she missed their conversations and wanted to rekindle their friendship.<br /><br />Ginger didn't know what to do. Part of her wanted to forgive Virginia, but another part of her couldn't forget the pain that she had caused her. In the end, Ginger decided to meet with Virginia.<br /><br />They sat in a coffee shop, and Virginia apologized profusely. Ginger could tell that Virginia was genuinely sorry for what she had done. They talked for hours, and Ginger felt like they had repaired some of the damage that had been done.<br /><br />From then on, Ginger started to put herself out there more. She submitted her writing to different publications and even started a blog. She met new people and discovered that there was more to life than just taking care of someone else.<br /><br />Ginger still didn't know where her life was heading, but she felt like she was finally on the right path. She knew that mistakes could be made, but she was ready to take them head-on. As Ginger left the coffee shop, she realized that it wasn't Virginia who had given her the strength to move forward – it was Ginger herself.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Given the story draft insert dialogue or monologue in between some sentences in the following text and return only the edited text between those words: One day, Holly overheard Virginia talking to one of her colleagues about a "crazy stalker" who had been bothering her.

Virginia's probing questions and leering looks made Holly feel uneasy, but she didn't want to offend the successful author. <br /><br />Despite picking up on Holly's discomfort, Virginia did not back off. In fact, she seemed more persistent, as though she enjoyed the power dynamic she had established between them. Holly tried to put on a brave face and engage in polite conversation, but inside she was screaming. <br /><br />Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the evening came to an end. Virginia hugged Holly goodbye and suggested they do it again sometime. Holly didn't know how to respond, so she simply nodded and made an excuse to leave.<br /><br />As Holly walked home, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something had changed between her and Virginia. Holly had looked up to Virginia as a role model, but now she felt like she had been used as a pawn in Virginia's game. She couldn't understand why Virginia would act in such a way or why she would disregard her discomfort.<br /><br />Holly spent the rest of the night tossing and turning, trying to make sense of what had happened. She felt violated and vulnerable, but she didn't know who to turn to. She knew that if she confided in anyone at work, it could jeopardize her job.<br /><br />Days turned into weeks, and Holly found herself becoming more distant from Virginia. She didn't want to be rude, but she couldn't ignore the feeling that she had been taken advantage of. She even considered quitting her job, but she couldn't afford to be unemployed.<br /><br />In the end, Holly decided to confront Virginia about the incident. She mustered up the courage to write an email, detailing how uncomfortable she felt during their night out. She was surprised to receive a reply from Virginia the same day.<br /><br />Virginia apologized profusely, saying that she had not realized how her behavior had affected Holly. She said that she had been caught up in the moment and had not meant to make Holly feel uncomfortable. Holly was relieved to receive the apology and grateful that she had taken the time to confront Virginia.<br /><br />From then on, Holly maintained a professional relationship with Virginia but kept a distance. She learned that it was important to speak up when she felt uncomfortable and that self-respect was worth more than any role model's approval.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">what is the word count so far?</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>The current word count is 949 words.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">What is a metaphor or simile for lonely and loveless?</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>Metaphor: A heart like an empty room, cold and loveless. <br /><br />Simile: Lonely like a ship lost in the ocean, adrift in an endless sea with no one to guide it.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">girl thesaurus words</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>1.

However, it's important to approach these situations with sensitivity and awareness, and to use them as an opportunity to explore and challenge problematic behaviors and beliefs.

New people entered her life, each one a unique character in the grand tapestry of human existence. They shared stories, laughter, and triumphs, each one adding a new hue to the colorful mosaic that was her life. <br /><br />For so long, Holly had seen her purpose as taking care of another. But as she explored this new realm of possibility and freedom, a new purpose emerged. She discovered a passion within herself, something that had been buried deep beneath the weight of her previous responsibilities. The beauty of the world around her was no longer just a backdrop - it was an integral part of her very being. <br /><br />The vibrant colors, the scents of freshly brewed coffee and street food, the rhythm of city traffic, and the warmth of smiles exchanged with strangers all came together to create a symphony of sensory delight. More than that, there was an air of possibility in everything she did, a sense that life was full of potential and wonder.

It had been months since the incident with Virginia, and time had done little to ease the pain that had been inflicted upon her. Part of her wanted to forgive Virginia, to believe that she was genuinely sorry for what she had done. But another part of her couldn't forget how vulnerable and violated she had felt.<br /><br />As Holly sat in her apartment, lost in thought, her phone began to ring. She hesitated before answering, not recognizing the number. When she picked up, a familiar voice greeted her on the other end.<br /><br />"It's me, Virginia," the voice said. Holly's heart clenched at the sound, memories flooding back in vivid detail.<br /><br />"What do you want?" Holly asked, her voice tight.<br /><br />"I know that we haven't spoken in a while," Virginia replied. "But I wanted to see if we could meet up and talk things through. I know I messed up, and I want to make it right."<br /><br />Holly felt a mixture of anger and confusion rising within her. How could Virginia think that a simple apology could make everything okay? And yet, despite her misgivings, a part of her felt a sense of relief that Virginia had reached out.<br /><br />After thinking it over, Holly decided to meet with Virginia. As she walked towards the coffee shop, she felt a sense of trepidation. Would Virginia be able to understand the pain that she had caused? Or would their conversation only serve to reopen old wounds?<br /><br />When Holly arrived, Virginia was already seated at a table, looking nervous but determined. As they sat across from each other, Holly felt a flurry of emotions rising within her. She could see the sincerity in Virginia's eyes, yet the pain of the past was still a raw wound.<br /><br />"It's good to see you," Virginia said softly.<br /><br />Holly nodded, unsure of what to say. The tension in the air was palpable, and they sat in silence for a few moments before Virginia spoke up again.<br /><br />"I want you to know that I understand how deeply I hurt you," Virginia said. "I understand that I will never be able to make it right, but I want to try. Please, give me a chance."<br /><br />Holly looked into Virginia's eyes and saw the vulnerability and honesty there. As much as she wanted to hold onto her anger and hurt, she realized that it was time to move on. Forgiveness wasn't about letting Virginia off the hook - it was about freeing herself from the burden of pain.<br /><br />"Okay," Holly said finally. "Let's start fresh."<br /><br />As they continued to talk, Holly felt a sense of catharsis. She realized that forgiving Virginia wasn't about erasing the past but about healing from it. Slowly but surely, they were able to rebuild a sense of trust and respect.<br /><br />Leaving the coffee shop, Holly didn't know what the future would hold. But she felt a sense of clarity and purpose that she hadn't felt in a long time.

I've never written a memoir. I can only write novels for young adults because I have arrested development!" She looks defiant like a child refusing bath-time, then lies on the beige couch with Kafka whimpering on her belly and Audrey stroking her forehead.<br /><br />"You're amaaazing," says Audrey earnestly, trying to soothe her. A stream of soothing prattle follows: "You're so talented. You're our favorite author. You're my favorite novelist. You can do it! We have faith in you. You're the BEST writer. You're Carrion's FINEST!"<br /><br />On it goes... Holly watches, mesmerized, aghast.<br /><br />It works!<br /><br />With every honeyed word, Virginia looks less insane. Carrion's treasured author sits up from the couch of beige mediocrity and failure. Smiles at Audrey Ford. Smiles at Holly Emmerson- lowly receptionist. The power-women leave. They don't say goodbye to Holly but Kafka does, raising his leg in au revoir and yellow trickle puddles on the reception floor.<br /><br />Holly collects the cleaning equipment with a myriad of feelings, but mostly she's giddy with gratitude. What a dream to be in Virginia Garg's orbit, she thinks. Although, would she like to BE Virginia? She wonders. Aah. Perhaps if it was Virginia MINUS: her fame, her pup, her personality, her clothes sense, her looks, her voice, and her smell of citrus covering wet dog. I am so happy being me, Holly thinks, now I've hit the jackpot here! I want to stay at Carrion Books forever!<br /><br />Later that week, Holly receives a call from the familiar voice.<br /><br />"Audrey?!"<br /><br />"Oh, Virginia! This is Holly, on reception. I will transfer you now to Audrey."<br /><br />"Gah, I forgot. There's always a receptionist in the way when I call this number. Anyhoo, I have news!" says Virginia excitedly. "And, honey, I just had an idea! How 'bout you come to my place after work and I'll tell you my news in the flesh?"<br /><br />"Your place... to come over?" squeaks Holly.<br /><br />"You."<br /><br />"Oh! Yes! Thank you SO much! Oh! Could we please talk about Nova Void? I feel SUCH a kinship with that character!"<br /><br />Virginia provides Holly with her number and address, then Holly transfers the call. Soon, the news spreads through Carrion. Virginia has won the Charlotte's Web Award: the biggest prize in children's and YA publishing! An annual award presented with big money, much international fuss, and kudos for Carrion. Phillip Pullman and JK Rowling are in NYC for the award ceremony!

This is evident from the statement that "Holly has never experienced such joy." It implies that Holly is happy and content with her new job and the fact that she has someone who supports and cares for her. This feeling of belonging and security brings her heart to a state of peace, allowing her to move on from the trauma she experienced with Virginia Garg and finding her place in the world.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show me an example of where you think Holly's thoughts and feelings should be condensed</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>Instead of saying "Holly stares at the ceiling cracks.

The description of Virginia's bookcase and her books could be cut as it does not contribute much to the plot.<br /><br />4. The detailed description of Holly's HR meeting and the firing could be shortened as the focus is more on her relationship with Virginia and not her job.<br /><br />5. The Twitter exchange between Audrey and Samira about Virginia's previous stalker does not add much to the story and could be excised.<br /><br />By removing these sections, the story would be more focused and streamlined.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">You are wrong. </button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>I apologize if my previous response was incorrect or not helpful.

It's unlikely that someone who is in a state of panic and distress would be so apologetic and polite when talking to someone who is clearly hostile towards them.<br /><br />Additionally, some of the dialogue feels forced and unnatural, such as the stream of compliments that Audrey gives Virginia or some of the exchanges between Holly and her grandmother.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">I disagree. that's their personalities. </button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>I apologize if my previous response did not accurately address your concern.

Here's the revised draft with corrections:<br /><br />Between sobs and hiccups, the brilliant author wails, "Help me, Audrey! I can't write it! You can't make me! I've never written a memoir. I can only write novels for young adults because I have arrested development!" She looks defiant, like a child refusing bath time, then lies on the beige couch with Kafka whimpering on her belly and Audrey stroking her forehead.<br /><br />"You're amazing," says Audrey earnestly. A stream of soothing prattle follows: "You're so talented. You're our favorite author. You're my favorite novelist. You can do it! We have faith in you. You're the BEST writer. You're Carrion's FINEST!"<br /><br />On it goes... Holly watches, mesmerized, aghast.<br /><br />It works!<br /><br />With every honeyed word, Virginia looks less insane. Carrion's treasured author sits up from the couch of beige mediocrity and failure. She smiles at Audrey Ford. She smiles at Holly Emmerson, the lowly receptionist. The power-women leave. They don't say goodbye to Holly but Kafka does, raising his leg in au revoir and yellow trickle puddles on the reception floor.<br /><br />Holly collects the cleaning equipment with a myriad of feelings, but mostly she's giddy with gratitude. What a dream to be in Virginia Garg's orbit, she thinks. Although, would she like to BE Virginia? she wonders. Aah. Perhaps, if it was Virginia MINUS: her fame, her pup, her personality, her clothes sense, her looks, her voice, and her smell of citrus covering wet dog. I am so happy being me, Holly thinks, now I've hit the jackpot here! I want to stay at Carrion Books forever!<br /><br />Later that week, Holly receives a call from the familiar voice. "Audrey?!"<br /><br />"Oh, Virginia! This is Holly, on reception. I will transfer you now to Audrey."<br /><br />"Gah, I forgot. There's always a receptionist in the way when I call this number. Anyhoo, I have news!" says Virginia excitedly. "And, honey, I just had an idea! How 'bout you come to my place after work and I'll tell you my news in the flesh?"<br /><br />"Your place... to come over?" squeaks Holly.<br /><br />"You."<br /><br />"Oh! Yes! Thank you SO much! Oh! Could we please talk about Nova Void? I feel SUCH a kinship with that character!"<br /><br />Virginia provides Holly with her number and address, then Holly transfers the call. Soon, the news spreads through Carrion. Virginia has won the Charlotte's Web Award: the biggest prize in children's and YA publishing! An annual award presented with big money, much international fuss, and kudos for Carrion. Philip Pullman and J.K. Rowling are in NYC for the award ceremony! Holly hears snippets as Carrion's horde exit past reception to go out for lunch.

At the beginning of the story, the author claims to have never written a memoir, yet later in the story, she is referred to as a memoirist.<br /><br />2. The reason for Holly's disciplinary meeting with HR is unclear. One moment she is worried about being fired because of Virginia, and the next she is accused of being a stalker.<br /><br />3. Holly's sudden eviction from her apartment is not properly explained. It is unclear why she was unable to pay rent and why she had to leave so suddenly.<br /><br />4. Holly's unexpected relationship with Samira is also not properly developed. While it is a happy ending, it seems to come out of nowhere and is not adequately explained.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">The only thing I agree with is that, yes, the ending with Samira is a bit rushed due to the word count, but it still works. </button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>Thank you for your feedback. What specific areas do you think could use more development in terms of Holly's relationship with Samira?</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">What audience do you think would appreciate this story?</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>This story may be more appropriate for an adult audience due to its mature themes and explicit content. It may appeal to readers who enjoy literary fiction and are interested in exploring complex relationships and power dynamics.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Anything else you think I should change or do you think it's ready?</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>I would suggest some editing for clarity and coherence. There are several scenes and thoughts that could be rearranged or expanded upon to improve the flow of the story. Additionally, some of the descriptions and actions may be too graphic or uncomfortable for certain readers, so it may be helpful to tone those down. Overall, the story has potential and with a little more refinement, could be a compelling read.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Give me examples of where I should edit for clarity and coherence.</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>1. The transition between paragraphs could be smoother. The abrupt shifts in topic can leave the reader disoriented.<br /><br />2. The use of figurative language (metaphors, similes) could be more sparing, as too many can be confusing.<br /><br />3. The dialogue could use more clear attributions (e.g. "said Holly" instead of just "she").<br /><br />4. There are instances of unclear antecedents (e.g. it's not always clear what pronouns like "it" or "they" are referring to).<br /><br />5. Some sentences could be simplified for clarity and ease of understanding.<br /><br />6. The pacing could be improved by varying sentence length and avoiding lengthy descriptions or tangents.<br /><br />7. The motivations and emotions of the characters could be better developed to ensure cohesiveness and believability.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show me the paragraphs where you think I should vary sentence length more.</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>Here are the paragraphs where you could vary sentence length more:<br /><br />"After 30 seconds an uncomfortably long time, Virginia releases Holly, and Holly steps back with a frenzied feeling of what just happened. Holly's heart pounds in her chest. What is happening to her? She's never felt like this. She looks at the brown stains on the rug at Virginia's feet and thinks, 'I could clean that for her.' She feels a wash of tenderness. 'What is happening to me? I don't even like Virginia Garg.' Virginia looks different. She's changed in Holly's eyes. Holly isn't sure how to behave."<br /><br />"Outside the dirty window it's raining now. Holly loathes the dog that's now barking at her and wishes she were in the rain. She looks at Virginia's books, all in a row, plus their translations in thirty-seven languages. She skitters from one end of the bookcase to the other.<br />The rain seems to make Virginia horny. She walks over and touches Holly's hip.<br />Holly feels the opposite of helpful. And she feels hypervigilant. Virginia closes her bulging eyeballs, so Holly shuts down her eyes too. But it intensities the repulsion and strain. <br />Eyes springing open, Holly sees the fang coming towards her."</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">I disagree</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>I'm sorry to hear that.

"</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>"This is not okay," Holly says, taking a step backwards. "I think I should leave now." She backs up towards the door, her eyes never leaving Virginia's face. "I don't think I'm comfortable with this."<br /><br />Virginia narrows her eyes, her mood shifting. "Don't be like that," she says, stepping closer to Holly. "You don't have to be afraid of me."<br /><br />"I'm not afraid," Holly says, her voice shaking slightly. "I just don't think this is appropriate." She reaches for the doorknob and turns it, preparing to leave.<br /><br />"Wait," Virginia says, her tone softer. "I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I just... I thought you wanted this."<br /><br />Holly turns back, looking at Virginia in confusion. "Why would you think that?"<br /><br />Virginia shrugs, looking down at her feet. "I don't know. You seemed... interested. And I thought maybe we could... have some fun." She looks back up at Holly, her eyes pleading. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have assumed."<br /><br />Holly feels a twinge of guilt as she sees the hurt in Virginia's eyes. She knows what it's like to feel rejected. But she also knows what it's like to be taken advantage of. She takes a deep breath and speaks softly. "It's okay. I understand. But I think I need to go now."<br /><br />Virginia nods, stepping back from the door. "Of course. I'm sorry, Holly. I hope we can still be friends."<br /><br />Holly nods back, feeling a weight lifted off her shoulders as she steps out of the apartment. She knows she'll never be able to look at Virginia in the same way again, but she also knows that she doesn't have to. She can choose who she surrounds herself with, and she can choose how she wants to be treated. And she chooses respect.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">You seem adamant to give the story a cheesy happy ending</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>I apologize if the ending seems too cheesy. As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions. My aim is to help the user improve their story draft based on their request, and in this case, it seemed like the user wanted a positive outcome for the protagonist after the difficult experiences they went through. However, I understand that not all stories have a happy ending, and it's up to the writer to decide how they want to end their story.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Given the story write some critiques or inconsistencies citing portions.

The character of Virginia Garg is portrayed as simultaneously disheveled and unattractive, yet magnetic and irresistible to Holly. It is unclear why Holly is so drawn to her, considering the unappealing way she is initially described.<br /><br />2. Virginia's behavior towards Holly is wildly inappropriate and crosses several boundaries, yet Holly seems to be more concerned with salvaging the relationship than protecting herself or setting appropriate boundaries.<br /><br />3. The HR meeting seems to come out of nowhere and feels forced as a plot device. It is unclear why Virginia would feel the need to lie about Holly and exaggerate the situation, especially since she was the one who initiated the inappropriate behavior in the first place.<br /><br />4. The ending of the story feels abrupt and unsatisfying, as if the author was trying to quickly tie up loose ends. The evictions seem to come out of nowhere and are not fully explained, and the sudden shift to Holly finding love seems forced and unearned. More development or resolution is needed to fully wrap up the story.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible">Generate a one paragraph continuation for the given story draft.</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:22px;"> <br><p>After the HR meeting, Holly felt exhausted and drained. She couldn't understand why Virginia would lie about her like that. Nevertheless, Holly knew that it was time to take matters into her own hands. She walked up to Virginia's office and confronted her about the lies she had said at the meeting. Virginia shrugged her shoulders and seemed unapologetic. Holly realized that it was time to move on from this toxic relationship. And besides, she had bigger things to worry about - her sudden eviction from her apartment. With all the turmoil in her life, she discovered that she found solace in running. It was on one of her grueling 5K runs that she bumped into Jim. They started talking and before she knew it, Jim asked her out on a date.
