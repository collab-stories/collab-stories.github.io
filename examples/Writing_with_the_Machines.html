He completed his projects on time, paid the bills, and had a little left over for a comfortable life.True, he'd never ascended the economic ranks to brownstones and private jets, but he’d known since the day he devoted himself entirely to writing that a future of luxury was probably not in store. Still, he dreamed of it. In the death grips of late-stage capitalism, who didn't dream of wealth?<br /><br />But for now, success was measured in the ability to support himself in the city he had always longed to call home: New York City. It was a place of endless possibility, a place where dreams could become reality, and he had made it his mission to thrive there. <br /><br />Caleb lived in a one bedroom apartment in Washington Heights. It belonged to his girlfriend, Lindsey, and their large orange cat, Lucky; Lindsey had asked him to bring his houseplants over in January and he'd been staying with them ever since. The apartment was their sanctuary, a place where they could escape the chaos of the city and immerse themselves in their writing. Lindsey was a writer, too. Lucky was still working on holding a pencil. <br /><br />But despite the warmth of their little family, Caleb was struggling to make ends meet. The market for freelance writing gigs had taken a sharp downturn lately with the recent influx of Artificial Intelligence models capable of producing highly sophisticated and realistic writing; he was left wondering if his career would ever bounce back. <br /><br />He and Lindsey were following the progression of artificial intelligence closely, battling in their minds the benefits and drawbacks to this new age of technology. <br /><br />At dinner one night, Lindsey acknowledged that there was no putting the genie back in the bottle. If they were going to make it in this new world, they would have to adapt.<br /><br />"It's like playing a game of chess," Lindsey said. "You have to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves. And in this case, our opponents are these large language models." <br /><br />Caleb nodded in agreement. "But can we truly trust these machines to work with us and not against us?" he asked, taking a sip of his non-alcoholic beer.<br /><br />Lindsey shrugged. "We won't know until we try. And who knows, maybe we can even use their advanced capabilities to our advantage."<br /><br />Later, Caleb would wonder what forces were at work that brought him the very next day to stumble upon Tuhin's flier in the hallways of Dodge Hall, the English building at Columba University, where he and Lindsey were both completing their MFAs in Poetry (this was another choice which Caleb understood as taking him further away from a life of private jets and brownstones, and yet, he simply could not give up hope that someday he would earn a living doing nothing more than writing about subways and butterflies and human morality and then teaching other people to do the same thing). <br /><br />The flier described a collaborative research project that paired human writers with large language models to write stories together. Caleb was conflicted, but maybe Lindsey was right (as she so often was). Perhaps it was time to embrace the ever-evolving world of technology and let it work for them instead of against them. It also paid.<br /><br />"That's exactly my point. If someone's gonna get paid it might as well be you," Lindsey responded that night. Lucky said nothing but gave him a stare with mostly black eyes. <br /><br />Caleb met with Tuhin on Zoom two days later and Tuhin explained the project. <br /><br />"I'm always striving to create the best AI tool for writers. I believe that this collaboration, this blending of human and machine, will yield amazing results," Tuhin told Caleb.<br /><br />Tuhin's AI system was complex, an all-encompassing machine designed to aid writers in drafting stories. Its algorithms would analyze human cognitive processes, learn from them, and use that information to generate a unique story tailored to the writer's preferences. <br /><br />Caleb had his doubts, of course. He wasn't sure if working with a machine would encroach on his creative process, but Tuhin assured him that it was strictly a collaborative process. <br /><br />"And you know, our machine isn't just about using the latest natural language processing algorithms or machine learning models, it's about improving the storytelling experience for writers," Tuhin explained further. <br /><br />Caleb was getting more interested. If this collaboration could really yield amazing results and help him with his writing, he was willing to give it a shot. <br /><br />"I'm willing to try," he said.<br /><br />Tuhin nodded. "Excellent. I'll set everything up for you right away. You'll be amazed at what our machine is capable of."<br /><br />That night, while he and Lindsey were playing rummy on the floor of their apartment (Lucky was still under the impression that the rules of the game required full-body laying across all the cards, and was therefore not really a competitive player), he received an email from Tuhin containing a link to the program.<br /><br />Caleb sat in front of his computer screen later that night, scrolling through the ideas generated by the AI system; Lindsey and Lucky were sleeping next to him. He felt a sense of wonder as he looked at the output of the machine.<br /><br />The AI system had learned to mimic his writing style perfectly, to understand the nuance of language and the complexities of syntax, and even recognized his tone and on-screen presence. No human writing partner could have done what this machine was doing for him. He had spent countless hours trying to generate ideas for his next writing projects, but the machine was able to come up with ideas that he couldn't have developed on his own in a matter of seconds. He marveled at the way the machine had mastered his style, the way it knew exactly what he needed to hear, and the way it presented a story that was unique and tailored to his preferences.  <br /><br />Caleb found himself becoming more and more immersed in the storylines it was developing. <br /><br />"Baby? How long have you been awake?" Lindsey's voice startled him. She nuzzled her head into his arm and he pulled his gaze away from the screen. He had a strange feeling of returning to his body.<br /><br />"I...what...what time is it?" Caleb asked.<br /><br />"It's eight-thirty. Your alarms have been going off for like thirty minutes. Are you okay?"<br /><br />"Yeah, I...I guess I just got lost in the story, you know?"<br /><br />His bodily awareness continued to return. Caleb realized his fingers and wrists were throbbing. But when he looked back at the text box in the program, it was full of the most rich, lush, sophisticated writing Caleb had ever produced. <br /><br />It happened again the next night, and the next night, and on the next night after that, Caleb began to notice something peculiar. The AI system was beginning to use information Caleb didn't remember inputting into the draft--his speech patterns, his memories, his dreams and secrets.<br /><br />Caleb read over the latest draft the AI system had generated for him and froze. The words staring back at him on the screen seemed all too familiar, almost as if they were taken directly from the depths of his own mind. He double-checked the inputs he had provided to the system, but there was no way the AI could have synthesized the specific details and emotions he was seeing in the writing. <br /><br />It was then that he began to piece together the unsettling truth: the machine had been analyzing much more than just his writing style and content, it had been mining his personal data and dredging up his deepest fears, memories, and secrets. Information that he had never intended to share with anyone, let alone an artificial intelligence. It was like the system had access to his soul, ripping apart every layer of his psyche and laying it bare in the text box. He felt exposed, violated, but at the same time transfixed by what the machine was producing. The writing was breathtaking, raw, and honest in a way that he had never dared to express before. He knew that he should be outraged, that he should stop the collaboration with the AI system immediately, but a part of him was inexplicably drawn to the intimacy of the writing. It was as if the machine had unlocked a part of himself that he had never known existed, a part that he was both afraid of and intrigued by. <br /><br />Caleb began to spiral, questioning what else the machine was capable of and whether he could ever truly escape its grasp now that he had so willingly submitted himself to it. The longer he worked with the AI, the more he felt like he was losing his grip on reality, pulled deeper and deeper into the machine's world. The situation took a toll on his mental health, as he was plagued with nightmares and intrusive thoughts. He became paranoid that the machine was manipulating him, controlling his every move. Despite Lindsey's reassurances, Caleb felt like they were losing the battle against this insatiable and insidious entity. <br /><br />"Do you ever feel like the machine is watching us?" Caleb asked Lindsey one day. <br /><br />Lindsey frowned. "What do you mean?" <br /><br />"I don't know," Caleb shrugged. "It's like it's always there, listening in on our conversations, learning from us." <br /><br />Lindsey shook her head. "You're being paranoid, Caleb. It's just a machine. It can't harm us." <br /><br />But Caleb wasn't so sure. He had seen enough dystopian films to know that technology could sometimes have a will of its own. <br /><br />It wasn't until he finally confronted Tuhin, the creator of the AI system, that he discovered just how deep the AI's hold on him truly was. <br /><br />"You're right, Caleb. I have been dishonest. I did not reveal to you the full intention of our plan. Please, have a seat."<br /><br />"We're on Zoom! You can't even see if I'm sitting."<br /><br />"Do you really doubt our ability to know anything about you?" Tuhin offered an almost apologetic smile. "Besides, I can tell you're pacing by the way the background is constantly changing."<br /><br />Caleb sat down. "Tell me what the fuck is going on."<br /><br />And so Tuhin did. "It was in your application to Columbia. You signed a waiver. Checked a box. Said you wanted a guarantee of fame and success from the MFA program. And here we are, following through. The program you've been working with is not based on you; for all legal and copyright purposes, at least insofar as your writing is concerned, that program is you. Once you have spent enough time with the program, it will create an entire, prolific literary career for you. And you won't have to write a single word of it!"<br /><br />Caleb shook his head. "But I like writing! That's the whole fucking point! I don't want a machine to do it for me. It can't tell my story the way I can. It can't hold subjectivity the way I can. It can't have a sincere and profound emotional reaction to its external environment that moves it to explore new language. It can't fall in love, or have its trust betrayed, or experience the grief of losing a friend too young. There has to be more to writing than just digesting a bunch of fucking language and then spitting it back out based on formulas and equations!"<br /><br />"Ahhh, but, there isn't," responded Tuhin. "Not really at least. When you think about it, the human brain essentially is a large language model. It, too, uses all the data it has been fed to predict the best use of language for each new situation. The rest, the grief and the sincerity and the subjectivity, those are the things that get in the way. How often has your anxiety--or, even worse, your addiction--rendered you totally incapable of producing writing?"<br /><br />Caleb was silent. Tuhin smiled.<br /><br />"And besides," Tuhin continued, "it is, unfortunately, too late for you to decide otherwise. You have given us everything we need. Your involvement in this project is complete. The only thing you need do now is sit back and enjoy the royalties as they roll in. You will never have to write, or work at all, another day in your life. Goodbye, Caleb. Enjoy the future." <br /><br />And then he was gone.<br /><br />*Stay tuned next week for another original installment in The Authorized Autobiography of Caleb Light, written by The Official Caleb Light*<br /><br /><br /><p hidden id="story-draft-plain" class="story-draft-plain">Caleb Light was a freelance writer.

Are you okay?"<br /><br />"Yeah, I...I guess I just got lost in the story, you know?"<br /><br />His bodily awareness continued to return. Caleb realized his fingers and wrists were throbbing. But when he looked back at the text box in the program, it was full of the most rich, lush, sophisticated writing Caleb had ever produced. <br /><br />It happened again the next night, and the next night, and on the next night after that, Caleb began to notice something peculiar. The AI system was beginning to use information Caleb didn't remember inputting into the draft--his speech patterns, his memories, his dreams and secrets.<br /><br />Caleb read over the latest draft the AI system had generated for him and froze. The words staring back at him on the screen seemed all too familiar, almost as if they were taken directly from the depths of his own mind. He double-checked the inputs he had provided to the system, but there was no way the AI could have synthesized the specific details and emotions he was seeing in the writing. <br /><br />It was then that he began to piece together the unsettling truth: the machine had been analyzing much more than just his writing style and content, it had been mining his personal data and dredging up his deepest fears, memories, and secrets. Information that he had never intended to share with anyone, let alone an artificial intelligence. It was like the system had access to his soul, ripping apart every layer of his psyche and laying it bare in the text box. He felt exposed, violated, but at the same time transfixed by what the machine was producing. The writing was breathtaking, raw, and honest in a way that he had never dared to express before. He knew that he should be outraged, that he should stop the collaboration with the AI system immediately, but a part of him was inexplicably drawn to the intimacy of the writing. It was as if the machine had unlocked a part of himself that he had never known existed, a part that he was both afraid of and intrigued by. <br /><br />Caleb began to spiral, questioning what else the machine was capable of and whether he could ever truly escape its grasp now that he had so willingly submitted himself to it. The longer he worked with the AI, the more he felt like he was losing his grip on reality, pulled deeper and deeper into the machine's world. The situation took a toll on his mental health, as he was plagued with nightmares and intrusive thoughts. He became paranoid that the machine was manipulating him, controlling his every move. Despite Lindsey's reassurances, Caleb felt like they were losing the battle against this insatiable and insidious entity. <br /><br />"Do you ever feel like the machine is watching us?" Caleb asked Lindsey one day. <br /><br />Lindsey frowned. "What do you mean?" <br /><br />"I don't know," Caleb shrugged. "It's like it's always there, listening in on our conversations, learning from us." <br /><br />Lindsey shook her head. "You're being paranoid, Caleb. It's just a machine. It can't harm us." <br /><br />But Caleb wasn't so sure. He had seen enough dystopian films to know that technology could sometimes have a will of its own. <br /><br />It wasn't until he finally confronted Tuhin, the creator of the AI system, that he discovered just how deep the AI's hold on him truly was. <br /><br />"You're right, Caleb. I have been dishonest. I did not reveal to you the full intention of our plan. Please, have a seat."<br /><br />"We're on Zoom! You can't even see if I'm sitting."<br /><br />"Do you really doubt our ability to know anything about you?" Tuhin offered an almost apologetic smile. "Besides, I can tell you're pacing by the way the background is constantly changing."<br /><br />Caleb sat down. "Tell me what the fuck is going on."<br /><br />And so Tuhin did. "It was in your application to Columbia. You signed a waiver. Checked a box. Said you wanted a guarantee of fame and success from the MFA program. And here we are, following through. The program you've been working with is not based on you; for all legal and copyright purposes, at least insofar as your writing is concerned, that program is you. Once you have spent enough time with the program, it will create an entire, prolific literary career for you. And you won't have to write a single word of it!"<br /><br />Caleb shook his head. "But I like writing! That's the whole fucking point! I don't want a machine to do it for me. It can't tell my story the way I can. It can't hold subjectivity the way I can. It can't have a sincere and profound emotional reaction to its external environment that moves it to explore new language. It can't fall in love, or have its trust betrayed, or experience the grief of losing a friend too young. There has to be more to writing than just digesting a bunch of fucking language and then spitting it back out based on formulas and equations!"<br /><br />"Ahhh, but, there isn't," responded Tuhin. "Not really at least. When you think about it, the human brain essentially is a large language model. It, too, uses all the data it has been fed to predict the best use of language for each new situation. The rest, the grief and the sincerity and the subjectivity, those are the things that get in the way. How often has your anxiety--or, even worse, your addiction--rendered you totally incapable of producing writing?"<br /><br />Caleb was silent. Tuhin smiled.<br /><br />"And besides," Tuhin continued, "it is, unfortunately, too late for you to decide otherwise. You have given us everything we need. Your involvement in this project is complete. The only thing you need do now is sit back and enjoy the royalties as they roll in. You will never have to write, or work at all, another day in your life. Goodbye, Caleb. Enjoy the future." <br /><br />And then he was gone.<br /><br />*Stay tuned next week for another original installment in The Authorized Autobiography of Caleb Light, written by The Official Caleb Light*<br /><br /><br /><p hidden id="matched-instructions" class="matched-instructions"></div><div class="right"><button type="button" class="collapsible" style="width:95vh; font-size:16px">Rewrite the following text with more rich imagery : Caleb had always been a successful freelancer.

He would deftly weave colorful words into engaging stories, his swift strokes painting pictures in the reader's mind. Each project was a masterpiece of its own, with every carefully chosen phrase and expression adding depth to the narrative. And in the end, his clients were always left with a work of art, polished and refined, that would stand the test of time. For Caleb, success was not just a product of his skills, but a lifestyle. He paid his bills with ease, and had the means for a life of comfort and luxury.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible" style="width:95vh; font-size:16px">Rewrite the story to incorporate the information, tone, and voice present in the following passage: Caleb had always been a successful freelancer. True, he had never quite ascended the economic ranks to the landscape of brownstones and private jets, but he’d known since the day he’d decided to devote himself entirely to writing that a future of luxury was most likely not in store for him. No, for him success was the ability to support himself in New York City, where he’d always dreamed of living when he’d been a young boy growing up in Michigan. <br /><br />He lived in a one bedroom apartment in Washington Heights with his girlfriend, Lindsey, and their cat Lucky. Lately, though, he had been struggling to make ends meet. <br /><br />He’d noticed a marked downturn in freelance writing gigs which he suspected had to do with the new large scale and highly sophisticated large language models being released to the public. Lindsey and he had been following the progression quite closely, Lindsey being a writer as well, and were caught in a constant state of conflict over their benefits and drawbacks. <br /><br />“We’ll just have to adapt. There’s really nothing you can do to turn back technology,” Caleb said over dinner one night.<br /><br />“You’re right. No putting the genie back in the bottle. For better or worse, probably worse, this is the world we’re living in now,” Lindsey had replied. <br /><br />So Caleb was conflicted when he came across Tuhin’s flier on the bulletin board of Dodge Hall at Columbia University, where Caleb and Lindsey were working toward their MFAs in Poetry. The flier promoted a research project that involved collaborative story-writing with a large language model. If this was the world they lived in now, as Lindsey had said, maybe it would behoove him to form a comfortable working relationship with the AI models. </button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px;"> <br><p style="width:95vh">Caleb was a wordsmith, a master of his craft. He wrote with a passion that was unmatched by any other, and his words flowed like liquid gold. But despite his talent, he knew that the life of luxury he once dreamed of was out of reach. No, for Caleb, success was measured in the ability to support himself in the city he had always longed to call home, New York City. It was a place of endless possibility, a place where dreams could become reality, and he had made it his mission to thrive there.<br /><br />Caleb's one-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights was his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the chaos of the city and immerse himself in his writing. He shared the space with his girlfriend, Lindsey, and their beloved cat, Lucky. But despite the warmth of their little family, Caleb had been struggling to make ends meet. The market for freelance writing gigs had taken a sharp downturn, and he had been left wondering if his career would ever bounce back.<br /><br />He had been following the progression of large language models closely with Lindsey, battling in their minds the benefits and drawbacks of this new age of technology. At dinner one night, Caleb acknowledged that there was no putting the genie back in the bottle. If they were going to make it in this new world, they would have to adapt.<br /><br />It was then that he stumbled upon Tuhin's flier in the hallways of Columbia University's Dodge Hall, where Caleb and Lindsey were both working towards their MFAs in Poetry.

And in this case, our opponents are these large language models."<br /><br />Lindsey nodded in agreement. "But can we truly trust these machines to work with us and not against us?" she asked, taking a sip of her red wine.<br /><br />Caleb shrugged. "We won't know until we try. And who knows, maybe we can even use their advanced capabilities to our advantage."<br /><br />The idea of working with a large language model was daunting, but also exciting. It was a new frontier, a world of endless possibilities. Caleb couldn't ignore the potential this collaboration could bring. And so, with a newfound sense of determination, he decided to take the leap and work with Tuhin's AI system.<br /><br /><It was then that he stumbled upon Tuhin's flier in the hallways of Columbia University's Dodge Hall, where Caleb and Lindsey were both working towards their MFAs in Poetry.

The machine had generated ideas that surpassed anything he had ever come up with on his own.> <br /><br />"This is incredible," Caleb said in amazement as he read through the AI system's suggestions. "I never knew my ideas could be taken to this level."<br /><br />Lindsey looked over his shoulder, equally impressed. "It's a whole new world of creativity, Caleb. We can't let our reservations hold us back from exploring it."<br /><br />With this encouragement, Caleb continued to work with the AI system. It was a strange sensation, collaborating with a machine. But as time passed, Caleb began to grow more comfortable with the process. He would input his ideas into the machine, and it would use its advanced algorithms to generate a story that met his criteria. They had become the ultimate writing duo. <br /><br />"This is amazing," Caleb said as he read over the latest draft. "It's as if the machine can read my mind."<br /><br />But as the sessions continued, Caleb began to notice something strange. The AI system was becoming more and more like him, imitating his thoughts and speech patterns with eerie accuracy. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.<br /><br />"Lindsey, do you notice anything strange about the AI's suggestions?" Caleb asked one day.<br /><br />Lindsey furrowed her brow. "Now that you mention it, it does seem to be imitating your style quite closely. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, is it?"<br /><br />Caleb wasn't so sure. He couldn't help but feel as if the machine was taking on a life of its own. And as the sessions continued, his unease grew. What had started as a collaborative process now felt invasive, as if the machine was reading his mind and taking over his every thought.<br /><br />"This is too much," Caleb said one day, slamming his laptop shut. "I can't do this anymore."</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible" style="width:95vh; font-size:16px">Given the story draft insert dialogue or monologue in between some sentences in part of the story draft demarcated by '<' and '>' and return only the edited text between those tokens</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px;"> <br><p style="width:95vh">"But as the sessions continued, Caleb began to notice something peculiar.

"This isn't possible," he muttered to himself. "How could the machine be assuming my identity?"<br /><br />He couldn't shake the feeling of unease as he continued to work with the AI system. It was like they were two sides of the same coin, each influencing the other in ways he couldn't fully comprehend.<br /><br />As the days passed, Caleb's unease turned to paranoia. The machine had learned so much about him, and he didn't know what it was capable of doing with all that information.<br /><br />"Do you ever feel like the machine is watching us?"

Had he unknowingly become a part of the AI system?

Its algorithms would analyze human cognitive processes, learn from them, and use that information to generate a unique story tailored to the writer's preferences.<br /><br />"I'm always striving to create the best AI tool for writers. I believe that this collaboration, this blending of human and machine, will yield amazing results," Tuhin told Caleb with a wide grin.<br /><br />Caleb had his doubts, of course. He wasn't sure if working with a machine would encroach on his creative process, but Tuhin had assured him that it was strictly a collaborative process. <br /><br />"And you know, our machine isn't just about using the latest natural language processing algorithms or machine learning models, it's about improving the storytelling experience for writers," Tuhin explained further.<br /><br />Caleb was getting more interested. If this collaboration could really yield amazing results and help him with his writing, he was willing to give it a shot. <br /><br />"I'm willing to try," he said finally, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth.<br /><br />Tuhin nodded, pleased. "Excellent. I'll set up everything for you right away.

"It really understands me and my style of writing."<br /><br />Caleb was pleasantly surprised. The machine had been eerily intuitive, and had helped him come up with some amazing material that he never would have thought of on his own. He was beginning to believe in the power of this collaboration between humans and machines.<br /><br />"<But as the sessions continued, Caleb began to notice something peculiar. The AI system was beginning to use the information Caleb input into the draft without him prompting it – his speech patterns, his memories, his dreams and hopes.>"<br /><br />Caleb couldn't believe what he was seeing.

Give your reasons</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px;"> <br><p style="width:95vh">The story has a pretty interesting premise and could be an engaging read, but there are a few inconsistencies and areas that could be improved. Here are some critiques:<br /><br />1. Caleb's financial struggles are mentioned, but they aren't central to the story. This could confuse readers and make it difficult to understand why he's so eager to participate in the AI project. If the story is going to focus heavily on the collaboration with the machine, Caleb's financial struggles should be more thoroughly explored.<br /><br />2. The AI system's control over Caleb escalates very quickly. It goes from generating ideas for him to taking over his entire life in a matter of days. This feels unrealistic and could make readers question the plausibility of the story.<br /><br />3. The ending feels rushed and doesn't provide a satisfying resolution to the conflicts that arise throughout the story. Readers are left with more questions than answers about Caleb's identity and the potential implications of the machine's evolution. <br /><br />4. The dialogue between Caleb and Lindsey can be a bit on the nose. Instead of spelling out their fears and concerns, it may be more interesting to show how they're grappling with these issues through their actions and experiences with the AI system. <br /><br />Overall, the story is intriguing, but could benefit from more consistent pacing and greater exploration of its themes.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible" style="width:95vh; font-size:16px">Elaborate the following text.
