The hotel they opted for was the Edelweiss Lodge, which had been recommended to them by their friends in Montevideo who were more familiar with European fine living than them. "That's where you have to go if you want a real Swiss experience. Mrs. Rimbaud, I believe, still runs the place. You will be delighted by her."<br /><br />Mrs. Rimbaud was a prim little package of a woman, well into her elderly years, who welcomed them at the reception desk in an obtuse Swiss-French accent. Mr. and Mrs. Carabajal were instantly captivated by the hotel's old world charm. The rooms were cozy, the food hearty, and the jacuzzi and sauna offered a chance for them to relax and rejuvenate. They indulged in long walks amidst the breathtaking landscape, basking in the serenity the Swiss Alps had to offer.<br /><br />However, after a few days, Mrs. Carabajal began noticing something peculiar about the hotel staff. Several of them walked with a distinct limp. Intrigued and curious, she pointed it out to her husband, but he dismissed it as her imagination running wild. <br /><br />"I noticed something strange about the hotel staff," Mrs. Carabajal said. "Strange? What do you mean?" Mr. Carabajal asked. "They all walk with a limp, every single one of them," Mrs. Carabajal replied. "What's the big deal? I haven't noticed anything of the sort," Mr. Carabajal shrugged. "But it's not normal, don't you think? Something must be going on," Mrs. Carabajal insisted. "Come now, you're overthinking it. It's just a limp," Mr. Carabajal dismissed her. "But I can't shake this feeling. There's something unsettling about it," Mrs. Carabajal said. "You're reading too much into it. Let it go," Mr. Carabajal sighed. "Why don't you go down to the outdoors pool and take your mind off of it."<br /><br />As the days passed, Mrs. Carabajal's initial curiosity turned into genuine concern. It bothered her that every single member of the hotel staff had a limp. The more she contemplated this oddity, the more it gnawed at her. Her husband couldn't understand why she was so troubled by such a seemingly trivial matter. Nonetheless, after a few days even he couldn't deny the validity of her claims, given that every staff member did indeed have a limp. Determined to uncover the truth, Mrs. Carabajal began considering different theories. Maybe the limps were part of a sympathetic act, a way for the staff to gain the guests' compassion. Or perhaps there was a secret plot to drive her insane. But she soon discarded these ideas as improbable. She considered all of these possibilities, and each she discarded as more improbable than the last.<br /><br />Now, look at the hotel maitre. Pierre (the nametag on his white shirt announced) had a limp that could rival a one-legged flamingo tap-dancing on hot coals. Every step he took seemed to have a little shimmy, a touch of pizzazz that made you wonder if he had secretly taken tap-dancing lessons from a whimsical penguin. It was as if his entire leg had a mind of its own, determined to have a party while the rest of his body tried to maintain some semblance of grace. And yet no one but herself seemed to notice!<br /><br />As time went on, something even more alarming occurred: Mrs. Carabajal herself began to walk with a subtle limp. At first, it was barely noticeable, but as days turned into weeks, her husband couldn't help but point it out. Their relationship strained under the weight of the mystery, and they found themselves embroiled in a bitter argument.<br /><br />Accusations and insults were exchanged, exposing buried resentments and insecurities. Mr. Carabajal accused his wife of attempting to manipulate and drive him to madness, while Mrs. Carabajal blamed him for his insensitivity and for not paying attention to her feelings. The tension grew unbearable, and a rift threatened to tear them apart.<br /><br />One morning, on the last week of their stay, Mr. Carabajal awoke to find his wife gone. Panic coursed through his veins as he frantically searched the hotel, calling out her name, but to no avail. The realization struck him like a dagger to the heart; his insensitivity had pushed her away, and now she was lost to him.<br /><br />Despair overwhelmed him as he spent the night questioning his actions, pouring out his regrets in heartfelt letters he had nowhere to forward to. As the final day of his stay arrived, defeated and broken, he gathered his belongings and prepared to leave the hotel and the memories it held.<br /><br />But just as he was about to leave, a maid entered his room to clean. His eyes were drawn to the subtle yet familiar limp on her left leg. As she turned to face him, the color drained from his face; it was his wife, but she did not recognize him. She appeared distant, as if trapped in a different reality.<br /><br />In a mix of confusion and desperation, he pleaded with her, trying to jog her memory and restore their connection. But it was futile. She stared blankly through him, seemingly lost to the world they once shared. After tidying the bed and dusting the crevices of the room, she promptly walked out, dragging her left leg across the carpeted floor.<p hidden id="story-draft-plain" class="story-draft-plain">When the circus season came to an end, Mr. and Mrs. Carabajal could think of no better place to spend a month than Zermott, steeped in the Swiss Alps.

Every single staff member limps. It can't be a coincidence!<br /><br />Mr. Carabajal: (dismissively) Oh, come on, Maria! You're blowing this out of proportion. It doesn't matter if they limp or not. We're here to relax and enjoy ourselves, not analyze every little thing that happens.<br /><br />Mrs. Carabajal: (firmly) This isn't just "every little thing," Alejandro. It's peculiar, and I can't shake off this feeling that something is amiss. Don't you think it's strange?<br /><br />Mr. Carabajal: (frustrated) No, I don't! You're overthinking, Maria.

It's insignificant compared to our happiness. Can't you just let it go?<br /><br />Mrs. Carabajal: (teary-eyed) It's not about the limping, Alejandro. It's about you disregarding my feelings, about not caring enough to pay attention, to be there for me. I thought we were partners.<br /><br />Mr. Carabajal: (remorseful) I...I didn't mean to make you feel that way, Maria. I just didn't think it was important. I'm sorry.

We're having a good time, and you're ruining it.<br /><br />Mrs. Carabajal: (hurt) It's not about the limping, Alejandro. It's about you not taking me seriously, not caring about what I feel.

She was too preoccupied with embracing the serenity of the Swiss Alps and the luxury of the hotel. It was only when she started interacting more closely with the staff, engaging in conversations and observing their movements, that the peculiar limping pattern caught her attention. The realization hit her like a bolt of lightning, and she couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling that there was something deeper going on beneath the surface of the Edelweiss Lodge.</p><br></div><button type="button" class="collapsible" style="width:95vh; font-size:16px">Could you make it less evident that the story is going to take a turn?</button> <div class="content" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px;"> <br><p style="width:95vh">When the circus season came to an end, Mr. and Mrs. Carabajal decided to take a break in Zermott, nestled in the Swiss Alps. They had heard great things about the Edelweiss Lodge, a charming hotel recommended by friends from Montevideo, who praised its authentic Swiss experience. Mrs. Rimbaud, an elderly woman who welcomed them at the front desk with a delightful Swiss-French accent, added to the allure of the place.<br /><br />The couple instantly fell in love with the hotel's old-world charm. The rooms were cozy, the cuisine was delicious and comforting, and the jacuzzi and sauna provided a much-needed relaxation retreat. They spent their days immersed in the breathtaking landscape, taking long walks and savoring the serenity of the Swiss Alps.<br /><br />After a few days, Mrs. Carabajal couldn't help but notice something intriguing about the hotel staff - many of them had a slight limp. Curiosity piqued, she mentioned it to her husband, who dismissed it as mere coincidence. Oblivious to her observations, he failed to see any significance in this peculiarity.<br /><br />As the days passed, Mrs. Carabajal's initial curiosity turned into genuine concern. It bothered her that every single member of the hotel staff had a limp. The more she contemplated this oddity, the more it gnawed at her.<br /><br />Finally, she shared her suspicions with her husband, hoping he would validate her concerns. However, he couldn't understand why she was so troubled by such a seemingly trivial matter. Nonetheless, he couldn't deny the validity of her claims, given that every staff member did indeed have a limp.<br /><br />Determined to uncover the truth, Mrs. Carabajal began considering different theories. Maybe the limps were part of a sympathetic act, a way for the staff to gain the guests' compassion. Or perhaps there was a secret plot to drive her insane.

The mysterious limp added strain to their relationship, turning their once-happy days into bickering and arguments.<br /><br />Accusations and harsh words flew between them, revealing hidden resentments and insecurities. Mr. Carabajal accused his wife of trying to manipulate and drive him crazy, while Mrs. Carabajal blamed him for his insensitivity and lack of understanding.

With the arrival of the final day of their stay, a defeated and broken man, he packed his belongings and prepared to leave the hotel, burdened by memories.<br /><br />But just as he was about to depart, a maid entered his room to tidy up. His eyes were drawn to the subtle limp on her left leg, which seemed oddly familiar. As she turned to face him, his heart skipped a beat; it was his wife, but she didn't recognize him. She appeared distant, trapped in a different reality.<br /><br />In a mix of confusion and desperation, he pleaded with her, trying to jog her memory and recreate their connection.

She couldn't help but observe that several of them walked with a distinct limp. Intrigued and curious, she pointed it out to her husband, hoping he would share her fascination. But Mr. Carabajal dismissed it as her imagination running wild.<br /><br />Undeterred by her husband's indifference, Mrs. Carabajal's curiosity soon turned into genuine concern. She couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something more to the staff's limps. It bothered her that every single member of the hotel staff had this unusual characteristic.

I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for it. Let's not get caught up in such trivial matters."<br /><br />Clara felt a pang of frustration rise within her. She tried to explain her concerns more urgently. "Carlos, don't you see? It's not just a quirk. It's every single staff member. And it's starting to bother me.

There could be a simple explanation, like an old workplace injury or a coincidence. I think you're reading too much into it."<br /><br />Clara's worry turned into a determined resolve. She couldn't let this mystery consume her any longer. She needed answers. "Carlos, I can't ignore this anymore. I have to find out the truth. There's something about this whole situation that doesn't feel right."<br /><br />Carlos sighed, realizing the importance of investigating further to put his wife's mind at ease. "Okay, Clara.

Now, Pierre had a limp that could rival a one-legged flamingo tap-dancing on hot coals. His walk was a symphony of unintentional comedy, a masterclass in unintentional humor. Every step he took seemed to have a little shimmy, a touch of pizzazz that made you wonder if he had secretly taken tap-dancing lessons from a whimsical penguin.<br /><br />It was as if his entire leg had a mind of its own, determined to have a party while the rest of his body tried to maintain some semblance of grace. He had this unique ability to shuffle and sashay at the same time, like a whimsical waltz gone slightly astray.<br /><br />Pierre's limp was so distinctive that it almost became an unofficial entertainment for the guests. People would gather around their tables, stifling their laughter as Pierre approached, knowing that they were about to witness a performance like no other. He would glide across the room, his foot tracing an intricate pattern on the floor, leaving a trail of amusement in his wake.<br /><br />Even the other staff members couldn't resist a chuckle when Pierre would unwittingly break into an impromptu dance routine, his limp lending an unexpected rhythm to his movements. It was like watching a slapstick comedy act, where the star of the show had no clue he was the center of attention.<br /><br />But here's the thing - nobody dared to complain about Pierre or make fun of his limp. Why? Because his infectious smile, impeccable service, and uncanny ability to balance a towering pile of plates on his tray without toppling over made him nothing short of a beloved legend. His limp was simply a quirky part of who he was, a whimsical touch that made the dining experience at the Edelweiss Lodge all the more memorable.<br /><br />So, while his limp may not have been the most conventional way to navigate the dining room, it certainly brought joy and laughter to the guests. And isn't that what a trip to the Swiss Alps is all about? Embracing the unexpected, finding delight in the quirks, and savoring the moments that make even a simple meal a truly unforgettable experience.</p><br></div></div><article>        <script type="text/javascript" src="highlights.js"></script>      </body> </html>
