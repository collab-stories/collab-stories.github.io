        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
        The development of large language models (LLMs) capable of following instructions and engaging in conversational interactions sparked increased interest in their utilization across various support tools. We investigate the utility of modern LLMs at assisting professional writers via an empirical user study (n=30). The <em>design of our collaborative writing interface</em> is grounded in the <em>cognitive process model of writing</em> that views writing as a goal-oriented thinking process encompassing non-linear cognitive activities: planning, translating and reviewing. Participants are asked to submit a post-completion survey to provide feedback on the potential and pitfalls of LLMs as writing collaborators. Upon analyzing the writer-LLM interactions, we find that while writers seek LLM's help across all three types of cognitive activities, they find LLMs more helpful in translation and reviewing. Our findings from analyzing both the interactions and the survey responses highlight future research directions in creative writing assistance using LLMs.

This allows writers to obtain model help in each of the three non-linear cognitive activities in the writing process: planning, translating and reviewing. Participants write short fiction/non-fiction with model help and are subsequently asked to submit a post-completion survey to provide qualitative feedback on the potential and pitfalls of LLMs as writing collaborators.
